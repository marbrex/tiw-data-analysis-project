### Source

This dataset was taken from *Kaggle*. \
You can find it by following [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)

### Description

To better understand the dataset, we need to understand each of its features. 

- #### age
  Age of the patient in years

---

- #### sex
  Sex of the patient
  
  - **1** = male
  - **0** = female

---

- #### cp
  **C**hest **P**ain type
  
  - **1** = typical angina
  - **2** = atypical angina
  - **3** = non-anginal pain
  - **4** = asymptomatic

---

- #### trtbps
  Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

---

- #### chol
  Cholestoral in *mg / dl* fetched via BMI sensor

---

- #### fbs
  **F**asting **b**lood **s**ugar > 120 *mg / dl*
  
  - **1** = yes
  - **0** = no

---

- #### rest_ecg
  **Rest**ing **e**lectro**c**ardio**g**raphic results
  
  - **0** = normal
  - **1** = having ST-T wave abnormality
    (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 *mV*)
  - **2** = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

> ECG: short for **e**lectro**c**ardio**g**ram, it's a routine test usually done to check the heart's electrical activity.

---

- #### thalach
  Maximum heart rate achieved

---

- #### exang
  Exercise induced angina
  
  - **1** = yes
  - **0** = no

---

- #### oldpeak
  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

---

- #### slp
  The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  
  - **1** = up sloping
  - **2** = flat
  - **3** = down sloping

---

- #### ca
  Number of major vessels (0-3) , colored by fluoroscopy

---

- #### thall
  Thalassemia, it's a genetic blood disorder that is characterized by a lower rate of hemoglobin than normal.
  
  - **0** = null
  - **1** = fixed defect
  - **2** = normal
  - **3** = reversable defect

---

- #### output
  Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
  
  - **0** = less chance of heart attack (< 50% diameter narrowing)
  - **1** = more chance of heart attack (> 50% diameter narrowing)
